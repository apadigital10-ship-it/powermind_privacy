<div class="card">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>PowerMind – Daily Affirmations</strong> mobile application
        (“<strong>PowerMind</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”) handles your information.
    </p>
    <p>
        PowerMind is a daily affirmations app available on the Google Play Store. The app is <strong>not targeted at children</strong> and is intended for general audiences aged 13+.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        PowerMind itself does <strong>not directly collect, store, or require any personally identifiable information</strong>
        from you within the app.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the app uses third-party services (such as advertising and analytics) that may collect information
        automatically for their own purposes, as described below.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        PowerMind uses the following third-party services, which may collect information such as device identifiers,
        usage data, approximate location, and other technical details to provide ads, analytics, and app reliability:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Google AdMob (Ads)</h3>
    <p>
        We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements in the app. AdMob and its partners may collect and use
        certain data to show you personalized or non-personalized ads, in accordance with their own privacy policies
        and applicable laws.
    </p>

        </a>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Firebase (Analytics & App Services)</h3>
    <p>
        We use <strong>Google Firebase</strong> services (such as Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics or similar tools) to help improve
        app stability and understand basic usage patterns (for example, which screens are used most).
        Firebase may collect aggregated or anonymized data about app usage and technical information about your device.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information about Firebase, please see Google’s Privacy Policy:<br />

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
        PowerMind offers <strong>in-app purchases</strong> through the Google Play billing system. All payments and billing
        information are handled directly by <strong>Google Play</strong>; we do not receive or store your credit card
        or other payment details.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any information collected in connection with purchases is governed by Google’s own policies:

<div class="card">
    <h2>No Direct Data Collection by PowerMind</h2>
    <p>
        To clarify:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not create user accounts inside the app.</li>
        <li>We do not ask you to enter your name, phone number, or address.</li>
        <li>We do not directly collect personal information such as contacts, photos, messages, or precise location.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any data that may be processed is handled by the third-party services mentioned above, under their own privacy policies.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        PowerMind is <strong>not designed for children</strong> and is not marketed as a kids’ app. It is intended for general users
        aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you believe that a child has provided personal information to us through the app, please contact us using
        the email below so we can take appropriate action.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        As PowerMind does not directly store your personal data on its own servers, there is no separate user database managed by us.
        However, the third-party services we use apply their own security measures to protect the data they handle.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
